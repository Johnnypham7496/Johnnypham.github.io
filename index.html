                <h3>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h3>

                <p id="web-developer-answer">
                    My Initial plan is not to be a web developer, but I am looking to become a backend developer since there are not enough people who have 
                    an understanding of the backend compared ot the frontend. I am looking to expand my knowledge about the frontend to build a full 
                    understanding of fullstack development.
